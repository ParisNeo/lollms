# requirements.txt
pip>=21.2.3
sse_starlette
# --- Core FastAPI and Server ---
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]  # Includes python-multipart and other useful server extras
werkzeug           # For secure_filename

# --- Configuration & Utilities ---
toml  # For reading config.toml
sqlalchemy
passlib[bcrypt]  # For password hashing (bcrypt is a common and secure scheme)

python-multipart

# --- LoLLMs Client Library and Common Backends ---
lollms-client>=1.0.0
ascii_colors>0.11.0
pipmaster>=1.0.0

# Dependencies for specific lollms_client backends (based on your config examples):
openai  # If using the OpenAI binding (e.g., for gpt-3.5-turbo)
tiktoken # Required by the OpenAI binding in lollms_client for tokenization

ollama # for ollama
# Add other lollms_client backend dependencies if you plan to use them, e.g.:
# torch
# transformers
# accelerate
# (Note: lollms-client itself pulls in requests, ascii-colors, pillow, pipmaster, yaml, pydantic, lollmsvectordb, numpy)
pydantic
pydantic[email] #for email validation
Pillow

# --- SafeStore Library and Common Features ---
# Using safe_store[all] is a convenient way to get most features.
# It typically includes:
# - sentence-transformers (for ST vectorizers)
# - scikit-learn (for TF-IDF)
# - pypdf, python-docx, beautifulsoup4, lxml (for document parsing)
# - cryptography (for encryption)
# - filelock (core concurrency mechanism for safe_store)
safe_store[all]>=2.2.1
wcwidth
# If you prefer to install safe_store features individually:
# safe_store
# sentence-transformers  # For 'st:' vectorizers like all-MiniLM-L6-v2
# cryptography          # For safe_store encryption if encryption_key is used
# beautifulsoup4        # For HTML parsing
# lxml                  # Often used with beautifulsoup4 for parsing
# pypdf                 # For PDF parsing
# python-docx           # For DOCX parsing
# scikit-learn          # For TF-IDF vectorizers (if you plan to use them)
