# --- SafeStore Library and Common Features ---
# Using safe_store[all] is a convenient way to get most features.
# It typically includes:
# - sentence-transformers (for ST vectorizers)
# - scikit-learn (for TF-IDF)
# - pypdf, python-docx, beautifulsoup4, lxml (for document parsing)
# - cryptography (for encryption)
# - filelock (core concurrency mechanism for safe_store)

# If you prefer to install safe_store features individually:
# safe_store
# sentence-transformers  # For 'st:' vectorizers like all-MiniLM-L6-v2
# cryptography          # For safe_store encryption if encryption_key is used
# beautifulsoup4        # For HTML parsing
# lxml                  # Often used with beautifulsoup4 for parsing
# pypdf                 # For PDF parsing
# python-docx           # For DOCX parsing
