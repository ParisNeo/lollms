    # Alternative: Set to a neutral state, e.g., if they were friends, they remain friends.

    # effectively making them "open" to re-friending. The other user would see nothing changed
    # until a new request is made or accepted.
    # This is still not ideal. The simplest "unblock" is to remove the block status.
    # What was the status before the block? If it was ACCEPTED, should it go back?
    # Let's assume unblocking means the relationship is now "neutral" (no record or a new PENDING if one wants to re-initiate).
    # For this implementation, let's just remove the record.
    
    # Revised: Unblocking sets the status to what it would be if no block existed.
    # If they were friends, they are friends. If it was pending, it's pending from other user.
    # This is too complex without storing pre-block state.
    # Simplest: Unblock removes the record.
    
    # Let's try this: unblocking sets the status to PENDING, with the action_user_id being the one who unblocked.
    # This means the relationship is now open for the other person to accept if they wish, or for the unblocker to send a new request.
    # This is still not perfect.
    # The most straightforward "unblock" is to simply remove the block status.
    # If they were friends before, they are friends again.
    # If the request was pending from the other user, it remains pending from them.
    # If the request was pending from the current user (blocker), it's now unblocked and still pending from them.

    # Let's assume the previous state was "nothing" or "pending from other".
    # Unblocking will effectively delete the friendship record, requiring a new request.
