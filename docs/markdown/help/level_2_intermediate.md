# Intermediate Guide

This guide covers advanced features like **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**, **Image Editing**, and **Social Connectivity**.

## 1. Data Stores (RAG)
RAG allows the AI to "read" your local documents (PDFs, Word docs, Text files) and answer questions based *only* on that data.

### How to use RAG:
1.  **Navigate** to the **Data Stores** view (Database icon).
2.  **Create** a new Data Store and give it a name.
3.  **Upload** your files. LoLLMs will "vectorize" (index) them.
4.  **In Chat**: In the discussion settings or personality settings, "Mount" your Data Store.
5.  **Query**: Ask questions like "According to the uploaded PDF, what is our target for Q4?"

## 2. Image Generation & Editing
If your administrator has configured a **TTI (Text-to-Image)** binding, you can generate art directly in LoLLMs.

- **Direct Generation**: Simply ask the AI to "Generate a picture of a futuristic city."
- **Image Studio**: Access this from the user menu for advanced control. You can perform **In-painting** (editing parts of an image) or **Out-painting** (expanding an image).
- **Vision Models**: Use vision-capable models to describe images you upload.

## 3. Social & Messaging
LoLLMs is a multi-user platform. You can interact with others on the same server.

- **Friends**: Search for users and send friend requests. Once accepted, you can send **Direct Messages (DMs)**.
- **Sharing**: You can share a specific AI discussion with a friend so they can read or continue the conversation.
- **Public Feed**: Share your best generations or discussions to the server-wide feed for others to see and like.

## 4. Discussion Management
- **Cloning**: Use the "Clone" button in the sidebar to create a duplicate of a chat. This is useful for "branching" a conversation into two different directions.
- **Auto-Title**: Enable this in settings to let the AI automatically rename your chats based on the first few messages.

## Examples
- **Example 1**: Create a Data Store with 50 research papers. Use the "Researcher" personality to summarize common themes across all of them.
- **Example 2**: Use the "DALL-E" binding to generate a logo, then use the "Image Editor" to change the colors of a specific part.
