Once you are comfortable with basic chatting, explore these powerful features.

## 1. Data Stores (RAG)

"Retrieval Augmented Generation" (RAG) allows the AI to read your documents.

1.  Go to the **Data Stores** view (Database icon).
2.  Create a new Data Store.
3.  Upload PDF, TXT, or DOCX files.
4.  **Mounting**: In your chat settings or personality settings, select this Data Store. The AI can now answer questions based on those documents.

## 2. Image Generation

If the server has an image generation engine (TTI) enabled:
*   Ask the AI to "Draw a picture of..." or "Generate an image of...".
*   In **Image Studio**, you can use specialized tools to edit or generate images with more control.

## 3. Social Features

*   **Friends**: Add other users on the server as friends to send Direct Messages (DM).
*   **Social Feed**: Share your interesting AI discussions or images with the community.

## 4. Personal Profile

Go to **Settings > Account** to:
*   Change your Avatar.
*   Update your password.
*   Set a "Personal Information" note that the AI will always know about you (e.g., "I am a Python developer").

## 5. Exporting

You can export your discussions to save them offline:
*   **Formats**: JSON, Markdown, or Plain Text.
*   **Location**: Look for the export button in the discussion header.
