# Beginner's Guide to LoLLMs

Welcome to **LoLLMs (Lord of Large Language Models)**! This guide covers everything you need to know to get started with your first AI conversation.

## 1. The Core Interface

### The Main Chat
The center of your screen is the chat area. 
- **Input Bar**: Type your questions here. Press `Enter` to send.
- **Stop Button**: If the AI is generating a very long response and you want to stop it, click the square icon in the input bar.
- **Regenerate**: If you aren't happy with a response, hover over the message and click the "Refresh" icon to try again.

### The Sidebar
Located on the left, the sidebar manages your **Discussion History**.
- **New Chat**: Click the `+` button to start a fresh conversation.
- **Folders**: You can drag and drop discussions into folders (Groups) to keep your projects organized.
- **Starring**: Use the star icon on a discussion to pin it to your favorites.

## 2. Personalities
One of LoLLMs' most powerful features is the **Personality** system. A personality is more than a prompt; it defines the AI's "character" and skills.

- **How to Switch**: Click the personality name in the top header.
- **Example Use Cases**:
    - **Lollms Coder**: Expert at writing and debugging Python/JS code.
    - **Creative Writer**: Specialized in storytelling and poetry.
    - **Academic Researcher**: Focuses on citing facts and maintaining a formal tone.

## 3. Customizing Your Experience

### Themes & Settings
Go to **Settings** (Gear icon) to change:
- **Theme**: Toggle between Dark and Light modes.
- **UI Level**: If you find the interface too complex, set your UI Level to `Beginner`. This will hide advanced technical options.
- **Avatar**: Upload a profile picture in **Settings > Account**.

### User Data Zone
In your profile settings, you'll find the **User Data Zone**. 
- Paste information about yourself here (e.g., "I am a web developer who likes minimal code").
- The AI will read this "context" before every response, allowing it to remember who you are without you having to repeat yourself.

## Tips for Better Results
1.  **Be Specific**: Instead of "Write a script," try "Write a Python script to scrape news from an RSS feed."
2.  **Use Context**: Upload an image or a text file by dragging it into the chat to ask questions about it.
