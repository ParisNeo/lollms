# Beginner's Guide

Welcome to the LoLLMs platform! This guide will walk you through the fundamental features to get you started.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction to the Interface</h2>

The main interface is divided into three key areas:

1.  **Sidebar (Left):** This is your main navigation hub. You can start new chats, browse your past conversations, and access other parts of the application like Settings and this Help page.
2.  **Chat Area (Center):** This is where your conversation with the AI takes place. Messages are displayed here in a familiar chat format.
3.  **Data Zone (Right):** A powerful area for managing context. You can add documents, text snippets (artefacts), and manage long-term memory for the AI. You can toggle its visibility from the header bar.

## Sending Your First Message

1.  Click the **"New Chat"** button in the sidebar to start a fresh conversation.
2.  At the bottom of the screen, you'll find the **chat input bar**.
3.  Type your question or prompt, for example: `Hello! Can you tell me a fun fact?`
4.  Press **Enter** to send your message.

The AI will process your request and stream its response back to you in the chat area.

## What's Next?

Once you're comfortable with the basics, try exploring different **Personalities** from the dropdown menu at the top of the screen. They can dramatically change how the AI interacts with you!
