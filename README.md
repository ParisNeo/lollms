## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.10+
*   Git

### Installation

The easiest way to get started is by using the provided run scripts, which handle setup and execution.

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms.git
    cd lollms
    ```

2.  **Run the Installer:**
    *   **On Windows:** Double-click `run_windows.bat`.
    *   **On macOS or Linux:**
        ```bash
        chmod +x run.sh
        ./run.sh
        ```
    The first time you run the script, it will create a Python virtual environment, install all required dependencies, and create a default `.env` file from `.env.example`. Subsequent runs will just start the application.

### Usage

1.  **Access the UI:** Once the server is running, open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:9642` (or the host and port you configured).
2.  **Create an Admin Account:** On the first launch, you will be prompted to create an administrator account.
3.  **Login:** Use your newly created credentials to log in.
4.  **Explore:**
    *   Start a new chat.
    *   Go to **Settings** to configure your profile and select an LLM model.
    *   Visit the **Admin Panel** to configure LLM bindings and other global settings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`.env` file)

Configuration is managed through the `.env` file in the project's root directory. When you first run the application, this file is created for you from `.env.example`.

*   `SERVER_HOST` & `SERVER_PORT`: The host and port the application will run on.
*   `DATABASE_URL`: The location of the main SQLite database file.
*   `SECRET_KEY`: **Change this to a long, random string for production.**
*   `ALLOW_NEW_REGISTRATIONS`: Set to `false` to disable public sign-ups.
*   `INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` & `INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Used on first startup if no admin exists.

For detailed information on all available settings, please refer to the comments within the `.env.example` file.
